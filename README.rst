Synopsis
================================================================================

Pyramid AssetMutator provides simple and dynamic asset mutation (also known as
compiling or piping) for your Pyramid_ applications.

Inspired by other more powerful asset management packages, its goal is to
provide a basic and straightforward mechanism for asset *compilation* (e.g.
CoffeeScript/LESS), *minification* (e.g. jsmin), and *optimization* (e.g.
pngcrush).

As of version 0.3, it also adds experimental support for template language
parsing (e.g. you could use view helpers like `request.route_url()` in your
CoffeeScript by installing the `pyramid_jinja2` package and using
application.coffee.jinja2 as the asset source filename).

Installation

.. _Python: http://www.python.org

Documentation
================================================================================

You can read the documentation at: https://pyramid-assetmutator.readthedocs.io/


Known Issues and Limitations
================================================================================

* Experimental support for Py3k/pypy.
* Doesn't clean up after itself (compiled/mutated assets aren't removed
  automatically).
* Mutator "commands" must print to stdout (see the documentation for more info).
* Hopefully obvious, but you have to actually have the specified compiler
  command installed and accessible from your working path in order for it to
  work.
